## Stay connected

For Federal partners:

* We have monthly office hours; check out the [MAX.gov page](https://community.max.gov/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=HHS&title=Federal+Audit+Clearinghouse+%28FAC%29+Transition) for details on timing and cadence. 
* The <a href="http://listserv.gsa.gov/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A0=GRANTSCOMMUNITY">GrantsFed listserv</a> is an excellent way to stay connected to the world of Federal grants. Critical FAC announcements that agencies may want to be aware of are made here.

For the public:
* If you're feeling behind, we gave a presentation at the [CFO Council's Innovation Exchange](https://www.cfo.gov/financial-assistance/resources/innovation-exchanges.html) that provides a high-level overview of the transition.

## News

* AmeriCorps is the first external partner to use the new data dissemination API built by our FAC engineers.
* We've introduced [GitHub FAC Discussions](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/FAC/discussions) to communicate with developers who are using the FAC API in their work. The GitHub site is primarily for a tech audience to ask questions, share ideas, and engage with other community members. It's open to federal employees and contractors. Be sure to review and abide by the code of conduct.
* We're wrapping up user research with Audit Resolution Officials, where we interviewed 18 individuals from 12 different agencies. The conversations were invaluable and provided insights into how FAC's data dissemination tools are being used and will help guide our future design processes.
* We're working with grantee and audit organizations like the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers, the National Grants Management Association, and GRANTS.GOV to keep all stakeholders informed regarding the FAC transition.
