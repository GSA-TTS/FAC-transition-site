# Welcome to the FAC

The General Services Administration (GSA) launched the new Federal Audit Clearinghouse in October, 2023. All single audit submissions should now be submitted using [our new system](https://app.fac.gov/openid/login/). 

Users can also [search single audit reports](https://app.fac.gov/dissemination/search/) submitted to the FAC since October 1, 2023. For the time being, [search and download of historical audit data](https://facdissem.census.gov/Main.aspx) will remain on the Census' site.

To help make this transition smooth, we've put together several resources for your use. In addition to being able to log in and complete the audit submission process, the new site includes:

- [An overview of the GSA FAC process]({{ config.baseUrl }}resources/instructions/)
- [Download links for the audit workbooks and instructions for completing them]({{ config.baseUrl }}resources/workbooks/)
- [Developer resources for using the new FAC API to access audit data]({{ config.baseUrl }}developers)
- [Our help center](https://support.fac.gov/hc/en-us)

## For ACEE submitters

At this time, the FAC is not accepting submissions for Alternative Compliance Examination Engagements (ACEE).
