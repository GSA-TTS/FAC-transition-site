# Welcome to the FAC

The Federal Audit Clearinghouse is transitioning from the U.S. Census Bureau (Census) to the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) on October 1, 2023. At that time, you'll be able to submit all single audits using our new system. For the time being, search and download of historical audit data will remain on the Census' site.

To help make this transition smooth for our users, we've put together several resources for your use. In addition to being able to log in and complete the audit process, the new site includes:
- [an overview of the GSA FAC process]({{ config.baseUrl }}resources/instructions/)
- [download links for the audit workbooks and instructions for completing them]({{ config.baseUrl }}resources/workbooks/)
- [developer resources for using the new FAC API to access audit data]({{ config.baseUrl }}developers)
- [policy information from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)]({{ config.baseUrl }}info/announcements) and [updates from the FAC]({{ config.baseUrl }}info/updates)
- easy access to [the Uniform Guidance]({{ config.baseUrl }}resources/guidance) and [Compliance supplements]({{ config.baseUrl }}resources/compliance)
- [a help center](https://support.fac.gov/hc/en-us)
