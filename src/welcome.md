# Welcome to the FAC

The General Services Administration (GSA) launched the new Federal Audit Clearinghouse in October 2023. All single audit submissions should now be submitted using [our system](https://app.fac.gov/openid/login/).

You can [search single audit reports](https://app.fac.gov/dissemination/search/) submitted since October 1, 2023. For now, [search and download of historical audit data](https://facdissem.census.gov/Main.aspx) is still available on the Census Bureau’s website.

Whether you're submitting an audit, using audit data, or developing tools with our API, we’ve gathered helpful resources to guide you:

- [Overview of the FAC process]({{ config.baseUrl }}resources/instructions/)
- [Download audit workbooks and completion instructions]({{ config.baseUrl }}resources/workbooks/)
- [Developer documentation for accessing data through our API]({{ config.baseUrl }}developers)
- [Visit our help center](https://support.fac.gov/hc/en-us)

## Note for ACEE Submitters

The FAC is not currently accepting submissions for Alternative Compliance Examination Engagements (ACEE).
