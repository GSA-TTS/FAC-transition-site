# {{title}}


The Federal Audit Clearinghouse is charged with disseminating Single Audit data to support Federal oversight of grants as well as public interest.

## Limits

We inherit the default limits provided by api.data.gov. The [api.data.gov developer manual](https://api.data.gov/docs/developer-manual/) speaks to these in greater depth. By default, keys are limited to 1000 requests per hour.

If API limits become necessary to maintain operational effectiveness, we will develop those limits in consultation with our Federal partners and update this page accordingly.

## Terms and conditions

All Single Audit reporting packages, with the possible exception of Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations, submitted under Uniform Guidance are available to the public per 2 CFR 200.512(b)(1). Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations may opt not to authorize the Federal Audit Clearinghouse to make the reporting package publicly available per 2 CFR 200.512(b)(2). For these exempted auditees, the text entered in Part II, Item 2, Part III, Item 5, and Part IV, Item 2 will not be publicly displayed on the Form SF-SAC for fiscal periods ending in 2019 or later.
