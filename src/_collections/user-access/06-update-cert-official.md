There may only be one Auditor Certifying Official and one Auditee Certifying Official per single audit submission. By submitting a new official, you will be removing the current official listed. 

Keep in mind that the Auditor Certifying Official may not be the same individual listed as the Auditee Certifying Official and may not be the same as any of the Audit Editors.
