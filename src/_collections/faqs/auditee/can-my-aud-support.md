question: can my auditor support my submission on fac.gov like they did with the system at Census?

Yes. We have worked with auditees and auditors to maintain the workflows you are familiar with. While there are some differences, it is still the case that auditees will work collaboratively with their auditors to upload their audit package and, ultimately, certify the legitimacy of their Single Audit.
