# Week of October 30, 2023

We launched search and are ready for users to begin searching single audit reports. This initial iteration of search leverages six different filters for sorting data.

## What we delivered

We work in [an agile manner](https://asana.com/resources/agile-methodology). That means we have a long-term strategy, medium-term features we work to deliver, and make continuous improvement and bug fixes to the existing product. We update our system through pull requests, or PRs.

- Features add new capabilities or documentation to the FAC.
- Improvements take existing code or text and increase its quality.
- Validations increase the integrity of the data collected or disseminated by the FAC.
- Decision records chart our product planning and decision making process.
- Debt payment removes, cleans up, or otherwise improves existing code.

## What's next?

We’ve released search, and will be continuing to make improvements. We’ll also be focusing on the migration of historical data, and doing some preparatory work to make future work easier.

Our priorities are:
- Adding the ability to add, remove, or change auditors and certifying officials who are attached to the audit.
- Adding the ability to search for and download Tribal audits.
- Adding the ability to bulk download search results.
- Adding the ability to resubmit a previously submitted and completed audit.
- Adding email notifications to alert auditees and auditors that a step is ready for them to complete.
