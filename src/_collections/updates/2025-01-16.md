## New Feature: Delete “In Progress” audits

The FAC has introduced a new feature that allows users to delete “In Progress” audits before they’ve been submitted. If you have an audit “In Progress” that you would like to delete from your FAC submission home screen, please review [this Helpdesk article](https://support.fac.gov/hc/en-us/articles/33450486755085-How-do-I-delete-an-In-Progress-audit). 

We document our work out in the open: Learn more about this feature by viewing [this ticket](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/FAC/issues/4434) on our GitHub board.

## Fixes and improvements

For more information on recent fixes and improvements, please refer to our [release notes](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/FAC/releases). They provide details on the features that have gone into production, along with updates on improvements to our site structure and operations.
