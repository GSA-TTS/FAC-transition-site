**Natural disaster deadline extension** 

Under the Stafford Act, the following were declared as major disaster areas: Puerto Rico (September 18, 2022), Alaska (September 23, 2022), Florida (September 29, 2022), South Carolina (September 29, 2022) and North Carolina (October 1, 2022). Consistent with these declarations, OMB has granted a six (6) month extension for all single audits that cover recipients in the affected areas and have due dates between September 18, 2022 and December 31, 2022. We encourage the recipients in the less affected areas to submit their reports as soon as possible.
