description: FAC Transition updates
---
We've introduced [GitHub FAC Discussions](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/FAC/discussions) to communicate with developers who are using the FAC API in their work. The GitHub site is primarily for a tech audience to ask questions, share ideas, and engage with other community members. It's open to federal employees and contractors. Be sure to review and abide by the code of conduct.

We're working with grantee and audit organizations like the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers, the National Grants Management Association, and GRANTS.GOV to keep all stakeholders informed regarding the FAC transition.

Join the Grants Community Listserv for Federal stakeholders to receive FAC announcements and other Federal grants updates.  To subscribe to the Federal grants community listserv, email `grantsfed@listserv.gsa.gov` with the subject line "Subscribe."

Visit the [MAX.gov page](https://community.max.gov/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=HHS&title=Federal+Audit+Clearinghouse+%28FAC%29+Transition) for details on our monthly office hours, including timing and cadence.
