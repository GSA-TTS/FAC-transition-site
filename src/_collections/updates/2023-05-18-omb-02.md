The FAC will transition from the U.S. Census Bureau (Census) to the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) on October 1, 2023. At that time, all submissions will need to be made through the [new FAC](https://www.fac.gov/) hosted by GSA, including all single audits for entities with 2023 FYE dates. Any draft not fully submitted to the Census FAC before September 30, 2023 may need to be completely re-started at the new GSA FAC. Click [here](https://www.fac.gov/) to access/bookmark the future GSA FAC site, and get updates about the transition.
