For any 2023 submissions with fiscal periods ending between January 1, 2023 and September 30, 2023, requirement 2 CFR 200.512(1) stating that single audits are due to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse 30 days after receipt of the auditorâ€™s report(s), is waived. These audits will be considered on time if they are submitted within nine months after their fiscal period end date.
