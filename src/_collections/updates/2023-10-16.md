We released the GSA FAC as a minimal viable product. That means we are continuing to work and improve the FAC. We work in [an agile manner](https://asana.com/resources/agile-methodology).

## Items of note:

- All UEIs are validating.
- We made significant improvements to workbook validations and their associated instructions.

If you previously encountered challenges submitting your workbooks, we recommend you try again.

## What's next?

We are currently working on [search](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/FAC/issues/2236). We hope to demonstrate a prototype to Federal partners this week for early feedback. We anticipate having the ability to search for and download audits by the end of October.

Our pending feature priorities are:
- Adding the ability to unlock audit submissions to edit and then re-lock for certification instead of starting a new submission.
- Adding the ability to add, remove, or change auditors and certifying officials who are attached to the audit.
- Adding the ability to resubmit a previously submitted and completed audit.
- Adding email notifications to alert auditees and auditors that a step is ready for them to complete.
