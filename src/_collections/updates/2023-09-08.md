Search and download of audit data from 2016-2022 will remain on [the Census' site](https://facdissem.census.gov/Main.aspx) through December, 31, 2023. This data will migrate to the new FAC by the end of the year.

Single audit data for fiscal year 2023 will be available via search in mid-October.

2023 audit data will be available immediately via [the FAC API]({{ config.baseUrl }}developers).

We will only be accepting single audit submissions for the 2023 audit year on October 1, 2023.

We will begin accepting late audit submissions for prior years on November 1, 2023. Auditees won't be able to amend audits until later in the year.

At this time, the FAC is not accepting submissions for Alternative Compliance Examination Engagements (ACEE).
