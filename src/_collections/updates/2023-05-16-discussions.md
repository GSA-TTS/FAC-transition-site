We've introduced [GitHub FAC Discussions](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/FAC/discussions) to communicate with developers who are using the FAC API in their work. The GitHub site is primarily for a tech audience to ask questions, share ideas, and engage with other community members. It's open to federal employees and contractors. Be sure to review and abide by the code of conduct.
