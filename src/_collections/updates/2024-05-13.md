# Week of May 13, 2024

## Resubmission

We're continuing to work with our agency partners and OMB on single audit resubmission. We're conducting user interviews with inspectors general and audit resolution officials and consulting with OMB on policy.

## Historical data migration

The team continues to work on a remediation plan for the roughly 1,600 historical audits that failed the initial migration. These audits have a variety of data quality issues that we hope to resolve over the next few sprints

## May code freeze

The FAC will undergo a code freeze from 5/17 - 5/31 to allow for security penetration testing. This testing is a required part of our authority to operate. During this time, we won't be making any updates to the FAC.
