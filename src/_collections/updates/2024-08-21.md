To help you understand our work, we’ll provide regular updates on the work we’re doing and what’s next. 

The Federal Audit Clearinghouse team works in the open. Our day-to-day task board can be found on [Github](https://github.com/orgs/GSA-TTS/projects/11/views/2) and prior updates are available in [our archive]({{ config.baseUrl }}updates/archive).

## Historical data migration
The Census data migration is now complete\! Users should be able to access nearly all historical records using [the Search feature](https://app.fac.gov/dissemination/search/) at fac.gov. We document all of our work for the public on GitHub. Learn more about what this project entailed by viewing [this ticket](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/FAC/issues/3364) on our GitHub board.

## Submission exceptions
The FAC has introduced a new process for accepting incomplete submissions under certain specified circumstances. There are three scenarios where users may be eligible for a Submission exception:

1. Your entity no longer has a valid UEI  
2. Your certifying official is no longer available  
3. Your finding reference number is not unique

If your submission falls under one of these scenarios for exception, please contact our [Helpdesk](https://support.fac.gov/hc/en-us) for further guidance. You can learn more about what validation waivers are and how they work by visiting [this ticket](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/FAC/blob/main/docs/architecture/decisions/0037-validation-waivers.md) on our GitHub board. 

## Fixes and improvements

* Summary page improvements for recently submitted records  
* Search and form submission improvements  
* Accessibility improvements

For more details, check out our [release notes](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/FAC/releases) which lists what features went into production as well as internal improvements to our site structure and operations.
