Once you have uploaded all of your workbooks, and they are all validated, you can certify the correctness and completeness of your audit.

The Auditor Certifying Official **must** certify first.

The Auditee Certifying Official certifies second, as the auditee bears the ultimate responsibility for the contents of the Single Audit.

If anything changes after the auditor certification (e.g. a workbook or the audit package is re-uploaded), then the Auditor Certifying Official will need to certify again.
