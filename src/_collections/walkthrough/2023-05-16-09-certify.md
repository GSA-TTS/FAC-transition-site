Once you have uploaded and validated your workbooks, it's time to certify the correctness and completeness of the audit.

The Auditor Certifying Official **must certify first**.

Auditee Certifying Officials **must certify last** because they are responsible for the contents of the single audit.

Any changes made after the auditor certification will have to be re-certified by the Auditor Certifying Official. This could include re-uploads of the audit package or workbooks.
