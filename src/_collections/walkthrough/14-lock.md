After validation, you will lock your single audit submission for certification. 

If you need to make edits after this step, you may unlock your submission from the audit status page. Before certification, you will have to re-validate and re-lock your data.

Make sure you save copies of your documents to your local drive before moving on to certification as **the FAC does not maintain versions for you**.
