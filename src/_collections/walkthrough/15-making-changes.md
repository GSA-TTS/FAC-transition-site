Anyone may unlock the audit package and make changes before final submission. To do this, click the "Unlock" button to return to the main audit checklist. From here you can edit the webforms and/or re-upload new workbooks for the SF-SAC.

**Any changes will have to be re-validated and re-certified by both the Auditor and Auditee Certifying Officials.**
