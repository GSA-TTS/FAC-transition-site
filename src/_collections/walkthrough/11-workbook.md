Next you'll upload the SF-SAC. This is a series of XLSX workbooks that collects the data on any audit findings, corrective action plans, etc.

We've provided [download links and instructions]({{ config.baseUrl }}audit-resources/sf-sac) for each of these workbooks. We recommend reading the instructions carefully as you complete the SF-SAC.
