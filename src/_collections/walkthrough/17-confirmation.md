The Auditee Certifying Official must complete this step.

Once you submit your single audit package, you can't make any further changes. What you have submitted is what will be available via the FAC's audit search.

The date the Auditee Certifying Official confirms submission is recorded as the FAC acceptance date.

We recommend you save a copy of your audit materials on your local machine. If you need to resubmit, having the originals will make the process much easier.
