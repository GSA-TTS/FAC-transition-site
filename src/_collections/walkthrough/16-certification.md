After you've completed the pre-certification validation, you can begin the certification process.

The Auditor Certifying Official **must certify first**.

Auditee Certifying Officials are responsible for the contents of the single audit. **They must certify last and confirm the final submission.**

Any changes made after certification by either party will have to be re-certified by all. This could include re-uploads of the audit package or workbooks.

If you are an auditor representing a Tribal entity that has opted to suppress its audit data, please review [this Helpdesk article](https://support.fac.gov/hc/en-us/articles/33916498169101-I-represent-a-Tribal-entity-that-has-chosen-to-suppress-its-audit-data-However-the-Auditor-certification-checklist-states-that-my-data-may-be-shared-publicly-Will-my-data-be-kept-private) for important information related to the Auditor Certification Checklist.
