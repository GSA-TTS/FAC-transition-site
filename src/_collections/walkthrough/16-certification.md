After you've completed the pre-certification validation, you can begin the certification process.

The Auditor Certifying Official **must certify first**.

Auditee Certifying Officials are responsible for the contents of the single audit. **They must certify last and confirm the final submission.**

Any changes made after certification by either party will have to be re-certified by all. This could include re-uploads of the audit package or workbooks.
