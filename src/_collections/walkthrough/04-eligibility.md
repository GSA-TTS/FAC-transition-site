Before starting a new audit, you'll answer a few questions to confirm your entity must submit an audit.

Per [2 CFR 200.501](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/section-200.501), the single audit submission process is for the following types of entities:
* Non-profits
* State and local governments
* Institutions of higher education
* Indian tribes or Tribal organizations

Entities that spend federal grant funds are required to submit an audit if they meet the following spending thresholds:
* $750,000 or more for Fiscal Years starting before October 1, 2024  
* $1,000,000 or more for Fiscal Years starting on or after October 1, 2024
