Before starting a new audit, you'll answer a few questions to confirm your entity must submit an audit.

Per [2 CFR 200.501](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/section-200.501), the single audit submission process is for the following types of entities who spend $750,000 or more in Federal grant awards in a fiscal year:
* Non-profits
* State and local governments
* Institutions of higher education
* Indian tribes or Tribal organizations

### ACEE submissions

At this time, the FAC is not accepting submissions for Alternative Compliance Examination Engagements (ACEE).
