Once you have entered the general info, we ask you to upload a series of XLSX workbooks.

We will be providing templates for these files, and they will be available from fac.gov.
        
Like prior years, there are some controls and validations build into the workbooks to help make sure your data entry is consistent. We check the basics (e.g. that you have correctly formatted your UEI), but it is up to you to check the correctness of your audit and findings.
