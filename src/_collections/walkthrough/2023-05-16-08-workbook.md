Once you've entered the general information, you'll upload a series of XLSX workbooks.

Templates for these files will be available from fac.gov.

There is some validation built into the workbooks to help ensure your data is consistent. This validation checks high-level items, such as confirming the correct format of the UEI. 

Ultimately, the auditee is responsible for the accuracy of the audit and findings.
