From top to bottom: A table titled 'Audits in progress', a table titled 'Completed audits', a section titled 'Create a new audit', an unchecked box that reads, 'I agree to the terms and conditions'.

Once logged in, you can create a new audit and see the status of audits currently in progress. You'll be able to view the status of all audits associated with your email address.

If you don't see the audits you expect after signing in, have the audit editor confirm the audit lists the email address on your [Login.gov account](https://login.gov/create-an-account/). They can do this by going to the [manage user access]({{ config.baseUrl }}audit-resources/user-access) section of the audit.
