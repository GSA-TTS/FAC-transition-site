The FAC now uses the Unique Entity ID (UEI) instead of the DUNS number.

On April 4, 2022, the unique entity identifier used across the federal government changed from the DUNS Number to the Unique Entity ID (UEI).
- UEIs are 12-character alphanumeric IDs assigned to entities by SAM.gov
- Data entry, entity registration, and searching in the FAC now require use of an entity's UEI
- DUNS Numbers are no longer accepted to create new single audit submissions
