This is where you will list the auditee and auditor certifying officials, as well as anyone who will need to enter data or edit the single audit. Be sure to gather the names and email addresses of all individuals who will require access to the audit before proceeding with this step.

Enter the email address for everyone who will need to edit the audit submission. You should include your email address as well. **Make sure these email addresses match the email addresses connected to the users' Login.gov accounts.**

If you need to make changes to users after creating the audit submission, you can find instructions on [our manage user access page]({{ config.baseUrl }}resources/instructions/user-access).

The FAC doesn't notify users when they've been added to a submission. We recommend notifying them yourself.
