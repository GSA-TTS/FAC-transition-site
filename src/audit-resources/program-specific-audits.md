# Program-specific audits

You must complete the Audit Information Form before you can submit your audit. Use the direction below to answer these questions for program-specific audits.

**Q: What were the results of the auditor’s determination of whether the financial statements of the auditee were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)?**

A: An additional series of questions will appear if you select the final item in the list regarding special purpose frameworks. Answer these questions based on the special purpose framework, not the financial statements.

**Q: Is a "going concern" emphasis-of-matter paragraph included in the audit report?**

A: Select "No" because going concerns don't apply to program-specific audits.

**Q: Is a significant deficiency in internal control disclosed? Is a material weakness in internal control disclosed? Is a material noncompliance disclosed?**

A: If you issued a separate report to meet government auditing requirements, answer these questions based on that report. If you didn't issue a separate report, answer "No" to each of these questions.

**Q: Does the auditor's report include a statement that the auditee's financial statements include departments, agencies, or other organizational units expending Federal awards which are not included in this audit?**

A: Because this question is not relevant to program-specific audits, answer “No”

**Q: What is the dollar threshold to distinguish Type A and Type B programs?**

A: Because this question isn't relevant to program-specific audits, enter $750,000 as a placeholder amount so you can continue your submission.

**Q: Did the auditee qualify as a low-risk auditee? (2 CFR 200.520)**

A: Review 2 CFR 200.520 and answer accordingly.

**Q: Indicate which federal agency(ies) have prior audit findings shown in the Summary Schedule of Prior Audit Findings related to direct funding.**

A: This question requires no special instruction for program-specific audits. Answer the question as stated.
