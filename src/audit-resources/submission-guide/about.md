# About this guide and the Federal Audit Clearinghouse

The Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) is the place to submit federal grant audits. Entities that spend federal grant funds are required to submit an audit if they meet the following spending thresholds:

* $750,000 or more for Fiscal Years starting before October 1, 2024
* $1,000,000 or more for Fiscal Years starting on or after October 1, 2024

Our goal is to make the single audit submission process as easy as possible. To complete your audit, you'll fill out a series of webforms and upload a PDF of your audit reporting package. You'll also submit the SF-SAC as a series of XLSX workbooks.

Everyone who edits or certifies a single audit submission must have an account with [Login.gov](https://login.gov/). This includes auditees and auditors. [Creating a Login.gov account](https://login.gov/create-an-account/) is fully online and secure.

This guide goes through the submission process step-by-step.
