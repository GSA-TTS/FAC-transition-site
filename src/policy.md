# Policy and compliance resources

The FAC operates on behalf of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). It follows policy and guidance set by OMB and adheres to the federal Paperwork Reduction Act.

## Uniform Guidance

The [Uniform Guidance](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200?toc=1) outlines the policy for single audits. States, local governments, and non-profit organizations should follow the guidance when completing audits.

## Compliance supplements

These guides from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) are meant to help auditors complete the single audit process. They include the Federal Agency Single Audit, Key Management Liaison, and Program Contacts in the appendices.
