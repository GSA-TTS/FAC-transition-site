# The FAC Transition

- The Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) is moving from Census to the GSA!
- In the near future, Fac.gov will become the long-term home of the FAC.
- More information about the transition will be added in the future.

To file your audits, please visit the current [Federal Audit Clearinghouse](https://facweb.census.gov/) page 
on Census.gov's website.

### For Federal Agencies

- AmeriCorps is the first external partner to use the new data dissemination API. Other agencies have requested keys, and we’re looking forward to working with them, too. You can request an API key at fac@gsa.gov.
- We’re introducing {{ m.linkify("GitHub FAC Discussions", glossary.sites.gh_discussions.url) }} to communicate with developers who are using the FAC API in their work. The GitHub site is primarily for a tech audience to ask questions, share ideas, and engage with other community members. It’s open to feds and contractors. Be sure to review and abide by the code of conduct.
- We’re wrapping up research with Audit Resolution Officials, where we interviewed 18 individuals from 12 different agencies. The conversations were invaluable and provided insights into how FAC’s data dissemination tools are being used. We are also reaching out to grantee and audit organizations like the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers, the National Grants Management Association, and GRANTS.GOV.

You can also read more from the project team on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/FAC/wiki) or on this website.
