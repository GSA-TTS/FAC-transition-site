## Testing scenarios

We have three testing scenarios. Please do your best to complete the first scenario before submitting your feedback form. The other two scenarios are optional but encouraged.

1. Scenario One: Use the submission materials provided via email. This will let you go through the process more quickly to get a feel for it.

1. *Optional* Scenario Two: Modify our provided submission materials. For example, you could insert intentional errors in a pre-filled workbook to see what happens when you try to submit it. 

1. *Optional* Scenario Three: Download [blank workbook templates](resources/workbooks/) and enter your own data. This scenario most resembles developing a new submission from scratch. (Reminder: No data entered as part of this test will be kept.)
