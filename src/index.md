# Welcome to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse

The FAC is where federal agencies and the public can find audits submitted under the [Single Audit Act](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200/subpart-F). Organizations that receive federal funds use our system to submit audits, and oversight professionals use those audits for transparency, risk analysis, and compliance.

## About the New Site

In 2024, the FAC transitioned from the U.S. Census Bureau to the General Services Administration (GSA). This new site reflects a redesign based on community feedback. You’ll find improved search, better documentation, and a more accessible interface.
