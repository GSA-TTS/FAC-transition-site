# The FAC transition

* The Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) is moving from Census to the GSA for the 2023 Audit Year.
* In October, fac.gov will become the long-term home of the FAC and will begin collecting 2023 audits in September of this year.

* AmeriCorps is the first external partner to use the new data dissemination API built by our FAC engineers.
* We've introduced [GitHub FAC Discussions](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/FAC/discussions) to communicate with developers who are using the FAC API in their work. The GitHub site is primarily for a tech audience to ask questions, share ideas, and engage with other community members. It's open to federal employees and contractors. Be sure to review and abide by the code of conduct.
* We're wrapping up user research with Audit Resolution Officials, where we interviewed 18 individuals from 12 different agencies. The conversations were invaluable and provided insights into how FAC's data dissemination tools are being used and will help guide our future design processes.
* We're working with grantee and audit organizations like the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers, the National Grants Management Association, and GRANTS.GOV to keep all stakeholders informed regarding the FAC transition.
