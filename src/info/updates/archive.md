# Archived updates from the FAC

The FAC is committed to working transparently and openly. In addition to our regular updates, you can find historical updates below.

      We launched search and are ready for users to begin searching single audit reports. This initial iteration of search leverages six different filters for sorting data.

### What we delivered

We work in [an agile manner](https://asana.com/resources/agile-methodology). That means we have a long-term strategy, medium-term features we work to deliver, and make continuous improvement and bug fixes to the existing product. We update our system through pull requests, or PRs.

- Features add new capabilities or documentation to the FAC.
- Improvements take existing code or text and increase its quality.
- Validations increase the integrity of the data collected or disseminated by the FAC.
- Decision records chart our product planning and decision making process.
- Debt payment removes, cleans up, or otherwise improves existing code.

### What's next?

We’ve released search, and will be continuing to make improvements. We’ll also be focusing on the migration of historical data, and doing some preparatory work to make future work easier.

Our priorities are:
- Adding the ability to add, remove, or change auditors and certifying officials who are attached to the audit.
- Adding the ability to search for and download Tribal audits.
- Adding the ability to bulk download search results.
- Adding the ability to resubmit a previously submitted and completed audit.
- Adding email notifications to alert auditees and auditors that a step is ready for them to complete.

      The FAC participated in the Single Audit Roundtable, providing an update on our work to date and planned next steps, and used the opportunity to discuss pressing needs for auditors, resolution officials, and IGs.

We released the GSA FAC as a minimal viable product. That means we are continuing to work and improve the FAC.

### What we delivered

We work in [an agile manner](https://asana.com/resources/agile-methodology). That means we have a long-term strategy, medium-term features we work to deliver, and make continuous improvement and bug fixes to the existing product. We update our system through pull requests, or PRs.

### Challenges

We encountered a bug on Friday, October 27th. This is not a bug in our software, but in one of our support systems. We are working with our systems providers to understand this bug and resolve it. Until it is resolved, we have to slow releases into our production environment. **This bug does not impact data quality or the current operation of the FAC.**

### What's next?

We are currently working on [search](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/FAC/issues/2236). We have a version ready for release, but are unable to promote it to production due to underlying system issues. Search includes the ability to download PDFs, both via the website and API.

After releasing search, our priorities are:
- Adding the ability to add, remove, or change auditors and certifying officials who are attached to the audit.
- Adding the ability to search for and download Tribal audits.
- Adding the ability to resubmit a previously submitted and completed audit.
- Adding email notifications to alert auditees and auditors that a step is ready for them to complete.
- Adding the ability to bulk download search results.

### Items of note:
- <p>All UEIs are validating.</p>
- <p>We made significant improvements to workbook validations and their associated instructions.</p>

If you previously encountered challenges submitting your workbooks, we recommend you try again.
### What's next?

We are currently working on [search](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/FAC/issues/2236). We hope to demonstrate a prototype to Federal partners this week for early feedback. We anticipate having the ability to search for and download audits by the end of October.

Our pending feature priorities are:
- Adding the ability to unlock audit submissions to edit and then re-lock for certification instead of starting a new submission.
- Adding the ability to add, remove, or change auditors and certifying officials who are attached to the audit.
- Adding the ability to resubmit a previously submitted and completed audit.
- Adding email notifications to alert auditees and auditors that a step is ready for them to complete.

      We released the GSA FAC as a minimal viable product. That means we are continuing to work and improve the FAC. [We work in an agile manner](https://asana.com/resources/agile-methodology).

The GSA FAC team worked to minimize change between submission systems. We have worked closely with auditors, auditees, and Federal users to achieve this.

### Items of note:
- <p>We've updated <a href=https://support.fac.gov/hc/en-us/articles/20299116907149-UEI-validation>our UEI validation criteria</a> to only require that an entity's UEI exists. This should reduce the number of UEI errors users experience.</p>
- <p>We know some users have found the error messages for workbook validation confusing. We are working to improve these messages.</p>

### What's next?

We know that not every tool you are used to is currently available, and we are working quickly to add features in the coming months.

Our goal is to be transparent and share our areas of focus. You can see what features are coming up in [our backlog](https://github.com/orgs/GSA-TTS/projects/13/views/1). 

We are currently working on [search](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/FAC/issues/2236). This will give Federal and public users the ability to find and download completed audits. Our goal is to have a first version of search and download available by the end of October.

Our other feature priorities are:
- Adding the ability to unlock audit submissions to edit and then re-lock for certification instead of starting a new submission.
- Adding the ability to add, remove, or change auditors and certifying officials who are attached to the audit.
- Adding the ability to resubmit a previously submitted and completed audit.
- Adding email notifications to alert auditees and auditors that a step is ready for them to complete.

      We're excited to see completed audits coming in and data exporting via the FAC API. That said, we know there have been some issues. We're doing our best to provide help center support for those as fast as possible.

### Items of note:
- <p>Some auditors and auditees experienced errors when trying to validate their UEIs. We identified the cause of the issue with sam.gov and believe we have implemented a fix.</p>
- <p>We are now collecting single audit submissions from Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations.</p>
- <p>Our engineering team improved workbook validations and addressed a bug in the FAC API.</p>
