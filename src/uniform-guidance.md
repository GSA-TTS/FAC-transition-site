# Uniform Guidance

The [Uniform Guidance](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200?toc=1) sets the federal rules and requirements for conducting single audits. 

If you’re a state, local government, or non-profit entity that expends federal funds, this guidance outlines how your audit must be performed, documented, and submitted. It also provides standards for auditors and explains responsibilities for both recipients and subrecipients.

To ensure compliance, refer to the full regulatory text linked above or consult your auditor or Cognizant/Oversight agency.
