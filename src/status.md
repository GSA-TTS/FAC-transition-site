**Audit search is currently limited to UEI-only.** You can search your UEI to confirm your audit submission is complete. The PDF report will still be available for download but summary report workbooks won't.

## Issue background
In mid-February, GSA completed the migration of historical data from the Census Bureau. This increased the amount of data in the GSA system exponentially and slowed down search performance.
Our team has released multiple patches to stabilize search performance since then but have been unable to do so consistently. For this reason, we've decided to reduce search to UEI-only while we focus on building new search tables instead of one-off bug fixes.

We're working as quickly and efficiently as possible to return full search functionality to our users as soon as we can. Thank you for your patience.
