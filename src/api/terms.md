# FAC API terms and conditions

The Federal Audit Clearinghouse is charged with disseminating Single Audit data to support Federal oversight of grants as well as public interest.

The Federal Audit Clearinghouse operates on behalf of the Office of Management and Budget. We distribute single audit reporting packages to federal agencies and the public.

All single audit reporting packages, with the possible exception of Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations, submitted under Uniform Guidance are available to the public per 2 CFR 200.512(b)(1).

Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations may choose to keep their reporting packages unavailable to the public per 2 CFR 200.512(b)(2). For these entities, the notes to the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA), text of audit findings, and their corrective action plan will not be available to the public for fiscal periods ending in 2019 or later.
