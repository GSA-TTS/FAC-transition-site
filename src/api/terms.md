# FAC API terms and conditions

The Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) provides access to Single Audit data to support both federal oversight and public transparency.

The FAC operates on behalf of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and is responsible for distributing single audit reporting packages to federal agencies and the public.

## Public access to data

Under [2 CFR 200.512(b)(1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200/subpart-F/section-200.512), all Single Audit reporting packages are publicly accessible unless exempted.

## Tribal exemption

Per [2 CFR 200.512(b)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200/subpart-F/section-200.512), Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations may elect to restrict public access to their audit packages. 

For these entities, the following documents are not available to the public for fiscal periods ending in 2019 or later:

- SEFA notes  
- Audit findings  
- Corrective action plans

These terms apply to all users accessing data through the FAC API.
