The FAC API shares public data from submitted audit reports.

To interact with the API, you will need an API key from Data.gov. To get a Data.gov API key, [fill out the Data.gov API key signup form](https://api.data.gov/signup/). This is free and requires a valid email address. When you receive your API key, treat it like any other credential:

- Don't share your key with other users.
- Don't commit your key into a repository alongside your code.
- Don't store your key in a shared drive where other users have access.
- Don't share your key in helpdesk requests or any other communication.

Once you have your API key, you can begin exploring the API. Use the resources below to learn more about the API's capabilities.

For more information on the FAC API and the information it provides, see our [terms and conditions]({{ config.baseUrl }}api/terms/).
