# About our data

The Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC)

1. **Collects** audit reports and associated data
2. **Publishes** that data to agencies and the public
3. **Curates** that data over time

The data collected by the FAC is **free to use and in the public domain**.

Many people use this data. For example: 

1. **Members of the public** explore how Federal dollars are spent locally and nationally
2. **Reporters** report on Federal spending to local, national, and global audiences
3. **Grants officers** review grantee performance as part of the allocation of funds
4. **Resolution officials** provide oversight of Federal spending from a programmatic and agency perspective
5. **Inspectors General** oversee the quality of Single Audits

## Using the data collection

There are multiple ways to use the data. 

If you want to access individual reports, you can [use our search]() and access the data and reports from the web.

If you want to write code to analyze large amounts of FAC, we [recommend using our API]().

## Making sense of the data

The SF-SAC is a complex data collection. If you want to analyze the data in the FAC, it will help to understand what the data is and what it means.

1. Read an [overview]() of the FAC collection and its parts
2. Explore the SF-SAC fields in depth by reviewing the [data dictionary]()
   
## Curating the data

The FAC contains data collected by Census and the General Services Administration. Both the data collected by Census and GSA contains errors. **Curation** is the process by which we:

1. Document known errors
2. Annotate or repair errors
3. Log the changes that were made

We do this publicly as a matter of principle. We believe users of the data

1. should be aware of where known errors exist
2. should know when and how the data was improved

We especially encourage people developing systems that interact with the FAC to [read more about our curatorial process]().
