# Download FAC data

Our CSVs ([comma-separated-value files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)) collect the data currently contained within the Clearinghouse for download and use on your computer. You can use the resources below to access and interpret all the data available from the FAC.

## Current data: 2016â€“Present

These files will be of most interest to users exploring audits of Federal grants made in the past several years. This is the same as the data currently [available in our search](https://app.fac.gov/dissemination/search/).

## Migration metadata: 2016-2023

These files will be of most interest to researchers, IGs, and oversight officials.

When data was migrated from Census to GSA, it was modified to meet the validation requirements imposed by GSA. These files record the changes made during that process.
