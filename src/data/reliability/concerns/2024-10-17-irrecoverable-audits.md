## Curation challenge

The handoff of data from Census to GSA was complete, but that does not mean the data itself was complete. 

There are two submissions for which the data was irrecoverable.

### Example

We do not have SF-SAC data for:

* DBKEY 243753, AUDITYEAR 2019
* DBKEY 247680, AUDITYEAR 2022

## Consequences

This is a hole in the historical record.

## Mediating the error

Uknown at this time.

## Possible resolution

Unknown at this time.
