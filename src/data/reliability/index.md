# {{title}}

We want users to trust the data they find on the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC). That means the information must be accurate, complete, and consistent.

Reliable data creates reliable outcomes-whether you're using it to inform policy, build systems, or conduct oversight. That's why we've built in checks at every step of the process.

## How we ensure reliability

We perform quality assurance from the moment data is submitted through its final publication. This includes:

- Built-in validations at the point of intake  
- Regular monitoring and review  
- Manual and automated corrections where necessary  

To learn more about our validation process, see [FAC Data Validations]({{'/data/reliability/validations/' | htmlBaseUrl(baseUrl)}}). For an overview of how audits are submitted, visit our [Audit Resources page]({{'/audit-resources/' | htmlBaseUrl(baseUrl)}}).

## What is data curation?

Sometimes errors are discovered after submission-by us or by the public. When this happens, we follow a structured process to review and correct the issue.

We refer to this as **curation**-ongoing work to maintain and improve the quality of our records. It's a bit like caring for a museum collection, but instead of art, we're curating public data.

You can [read more about curation]({{'/data/reliability/curation/' | htmlBaseUrl(baseUrl)}}) and view known issues in our [Data Concerns]({{'/data/reliability/concerns/' | htmlBaseUrl(baseUrl)}}) list.

## Continuous improvement

When we find a bug or data issue, we log it in our [public GitHub backlog](https://github.com/orgs/GSA-TTS/projects/11/views/6?filterQuery=is%3Aopen+status%3ABacklog). You can view our plans for future work on the [Updates page]({{'/updates/' | htmlBaseUrl(baseUrl)}}).
